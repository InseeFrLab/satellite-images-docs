The interest in having deeper hidden layers has recently begun to surpass classical methods performance in different fields; especially in pattern recognition. One of the most popular deep neural networks is the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It take this name from mathematical linear operation between matrixes called convolution. CNN have multiple layers; including convolutional layer, non-linearity layer, pooling layer and fully-connected layer. The convolutional and fully-connected layers have parameters but pooling and non-linearity layers don’t have parameters. The CNN has an excellent performance in machine learning problems. Specially the applications that deal with image data, such as largest image classification data set (Image Net), computer vision, and in natural language processing (NLP) and the results achieved were very amazing.

The typical segmentation architecture is composed of (a) a downsampling path responsible for extracting coarse semantic features, followed by (b) an upsampling path trained to recover the input image resolution at the output of the model and, optionally, (c) a post-processing module (e.g. Conditional Random Fields) to refine the model predictions. Recently, a new CNN architecture, Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (DenseNets), has shown excellent results on image classification tasks. The idea of DenseNets is based on the observation that if each layer is directly connected to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion then the network will be more accurate and easier to train. In this paper, we extend DenseNets to deal with the problem of semantic segmentation. We achieve state-of-the-art results on urban scene benchmark datasets such as CamVid and Gatech, without any further post-processing module nor pretraining.

One way of estimating a product is to use remote sensing data in conjunction with field data and meteorological data. One of the main issues surrounding this comprises the use of machine learning techniques to create a multi-resource data-based estimation model. Many studies have been conducted on barley yield prediction from planting to harvest. Still, the effect of different time intervals on yield prediction has not been investigated. Furthermore, the effect of different periods on yield prediction has not been investigated. RESULTS In the present study, the whole growth period was divided into three parts. Using one of the major barley production areas in Iran, the performance of the proposed model was evaluated. In the first step, a model for integrating field data, remote sensing data and meteorological data was prepared. The results obtained show that, among the four machine learning methods implemented, the gaussian process regression algorithm performed best and estimated yield with r2 = 0.84, root mean square error = 737 kg ha−1 and mean absolute = 650 kg ha−1, 1 month before harvest. CONCLUSION It was found that the estimation results change depending on different agricultural zones and temporal training settings. The findings of the present study provide a powerful potential tool for the yield prediction of barley using multi-source data and machine learning. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry}, number={3}, journal={Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture}, author={Sharifi, Alireza}, year={2021}, pages={891–896} }

The proposed architecture, called ReSeg, is based on the recently introduced ReNet model for image classification.

Each ReNet layer is composed of four RNN that sweep the image horizontally and vertically in both directions, encoding patches or activations, and providing relevant global information. Moreover, ReNet layers are stacked on top of pre-trained convolutional layers, benefiting from generic local features. Upsampling layers follow ReNet layers to recover the original image resolution in the final predictions. The proposed ReSeg architecture is efficient, flexible and suitable for a variety of semantic segmentation tasks. We evaluate ReSeg on several widely-used semantic segmentation datasets: Weizmann Horse, Oxford Flower, and CamVid; achieving state-of-the-art performance. Results show that ReSeg can act as a suitable architecture for semantic segmentation tasks, and may have further applications in other structured prediction problems.

Most existing methods can segment buildings but cannot discriminate adjacent buildings. Here, we present a new convolutional neural network architecture (CNN) called U-net-id that performs building instance segmentation. The proposed network is trained with WorldView-3 satellite RGB images (0.3 m) and three different labeled masks. The first is the building mask; the second is the border mask, which is the border of the building segment with 4 pixels added outside and 3 pixels inside; and the third is the inner segment mask, which is the segment of the building diminished by 2 pixels. The architecture consists of three parallel paths, one for each mask, all starting with a U-net model. To accurately capture the overlap between the masks, all activation layers of the U-nets are copied and concatenated on each path and sent to two additional convolutional layers before the output activation layers. The method was tested with a dataset of 7563 manually delineated individual buildings of the city of Joanópolis-SP, Brazil. On this dataset, the semantic segmentation showed an overall accuracy of 97.67\% and an F1-Score of 0.937 and the building individual instance segmentation showed good performance with a mean intersection over union (IoU) of 0.582 (median IoU = 0.694).}, number={1010}, journal={Remote Sensing}, publisher={Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute}, author={Wagner, Fabien H. and Dalagnol, Ricardo and Tarabalka, Yuliya and Segantine, Tassiana Y.

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods.

ABSTRACT = {Up-to-date information about the Earth&rsquo;s surface provided by land cover maps is essential for numerous environmental and land management applications. There is, therefore, a clear need for the continuous and reliable monitoring of land cover and land cover changes. The growing availability of high resolution, regularly collected remote sensing data can support the increasing number of applications that require high spatial resolution products that are frequently updated (e.g., annually). However, large-scale operational mapping requires a highly-automated data processing workflow, which is currently lacking. To address this issue, we developed a methodology for the automated classification of multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery. The method uses a random forest classifier and existing land cover/use databases as the source of training samples. In order to demonstrate its operability, the method was implemented on a large part of the European continent, with CORINE Land Cover and High-Resolution Layers as training datasets. A land cover/use map for the year 2017 was produced, composed of 13 classes. An accuracy assessment, based on nearly 52,000 samples, revealed high thematic overall accuracy (86.1\%) on a continental scale, and average overall accuracy of 86.5\% at country level. Only low-frequency classes obtained lower accuracies and we recommend that their mapping should be improved in the future. Additional modifications to the classification legend, notably the fusion of thematically and spectrally similar vegetation classes, increased overall accuracy to 89.0\%, and resulted in ten, general classes. A crucial aspect of the presented approach is that it embraces all of the most important elements of Earth observation data processing, enabling accurate and detailed (10 m spatial resolution) mapping with no manual user involvement. The presented methodology demonstrates possibility for frequent and repetitive operational production of large-scale land cover maps.},
