## Technical Environment

- [**Cloud-native architecture**]{.orange} ([**SSPCloud**]{.blue2} platform)
- [**Modern tech stack**]{.orange}: Kubernetes, Docker, MLFlow, React
- [**Automated workflows**]{.orange} for [**reproducibility**]{.blue2}
- [**Continuous deployment**]{.orange} of applications

## Processing Pipeline 

![](../img/pipeline_donnees_sat_en.png){#fig-chain2 width=100% height=100%}

::: {.notes}

1. Need for standardisation of acquisition of data => for now rudimentary. Also need dated images but also in due time without clouds and same methodology => challenge of Pleaides
2. Step for training. Clouds removals/ balancing datasets, labeling and splitting
3. pytorch with pre trained model from HF. Need GPU
4. Build API : predict images, cluster or bbox and compute building area statistics
5. DÃ©ploying Geoserver and a web application
6. Colleagues of Insee uses or results to make their statistics

## Technical Implementation

- [**Complex technical environment**]{.orange} due to:
    - [**Non-traditional data**]{.blue2} processing
    - [**Large data volumes**]{.blue2}
    - [**High computational needs**]{.blue2}
    - [**Reproducibility requirements**]{.blue2}

## Challenges & Perspectives

- [**High maintenance costs**]{.orange} due to technical complexity
- Need for [**specialized skills**]{.blue2}
- [**Promising results**]{.orange} for cartographic survey support
- [**Potential improvements**]{.orange} identified for each pipeline stage
