## Context

- Insee is maintaining a [**register of localized buildings**]{.orange} (RIL)
  - Exhaustive informations on housing for +10k inhab cities 
  - Used to constitute the [**sampling frames**]{.blue2} for census survey
- The RIL is [**good quality**]{.orange} for metropolitan France...
  - ... but France is also [**overseas territories**]{.blue2} (OTs) !
  - There [**quality is much lower**]{.blue2}

## Census in overseas territories

- [**Cartographic survey**]{.orange} is conducted in OTs prior the census

- [**Critical context**]{.orange} especially in Mayotte and French Guyana:
  - Local authorities [**questioning official statistics**]{.blue2}
  - Rapid [**urban development**]{.blue2}
  - Challenging [**field conditions**]{.blue2}

- Lot of (difficult) [**work**]{.orange} and very [**costly**]{.orange}

- Could we use [**satellite images**]{.orange} to optimize the process of census in OTs ?

::: {.notes}

- [**Satellite data as supporting evidence**]{.orange}:
  - Independent source of information
  - Continuous territorial monitoring
  - Transparent methodology

## Our use cases

- [**Pre cartographic survey**]{.orange}:
  - Identification of [**priority areas**]{.blue2} for field operations
  - Detection of [**building changes**]{.blue2} between surveys
  - [**Temporal comparison**]{.blue2} using historical and recent imagery

- [**Post cartographic survey**]{.orange}:
  - [**Automated change detection**]{.blue2}
  - [**Land use evolution**]{.blue2}
  - Support for [**population estimates**]{.blue2} in OTs

- [**Extraordinary use case**]{.orange}: Chido devasting tropical cyclone
