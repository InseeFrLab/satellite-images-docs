## Training a Segmentation Model

- Model trained to perform automatic segmentation [**from annotated examples**]{.orange}. Requirements:
    - [**Collection**]{.blue2} of satellite images
    - [**Production of annotations**]{.blue2} (building footprints)
- Model learns to reproduce annotations from images, with the goal to [**generalize**]{.orange} to new images

## From Segmentation to Change Detection

## Methodology Details

- [**Model architecture**]{.orange}:
    - SegFormer backbone
    - Transformer-based encoder
    - Lightweight decoder
